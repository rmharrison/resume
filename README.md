resume
======

Hacked together LaTeX resume, with slightly modified stand-alone res.cls package

Many thanks...
  - res package (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/res)
  - RPI for useful templates (http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/)

"Features"
  - res package
    . Modified to include three addresses
    . Diddled with default section and name formatting (\sf)
  - Pretty number formatting (\usepackage[osf]{mathpazo})
  - More prettifying (\usepackage{microtype}, \usepackage[english]{babel})
  - In-line links to articles/reference, such as for the afformentioned commands.
