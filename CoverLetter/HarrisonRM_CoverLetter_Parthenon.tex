% Opening
Dear Ms. Harvey, % HR contact from 2013 Management consultancy book

\textbf{Re: Associate via Oxford recruiting, London Office}

% Write the body of the letter
As a final year DPhil in Computational Biophysics at the University of Oxford, I've honed my analytical and quantitative skills. The aim is not to abandon my training; rather, to gain a broader perspective and ultimately command considerably more leverage as a consultant, than I ever could as ``Just A Programmer.'' 

Over the years, I've met with Parthenon at the Oxford Consultancy Fairs, taken on a team-based Oxford Student Consultancy project and reached out to PhD scientists that have successfully made the transition. It has been impressed upon me how potent the analytical and problem solving expertise of a doctorate can be when applied through the lens of business, a path I hope to follow. I'm committed to beginning my career in consulting and think that Parthenon would be a fit.

While I intend to begin my career as a generalist, as a Baltimore-native and product of the Baltimore City Public School system -- a school system notorious for it's poor performance -- I'm naturally drawn to the education practice. When I read Jonathan Kozol, or popular press articles, such as the Parthenon case study in New York City, I can't help but think back to my personal experience: 50 person English classes due to teachers lost to cost cutting, mouldy textbooks 30 years out of date. Par for the course in an urban school district in America. Shame is, I was one of the lucky ones who managed to eke out a decent education; not due to any particular mythical Horatio Alger ability, but because my parents, a school teacher and a janitor, knew how to play the system. I want to add value to clients; when the impact is life changing, say an alternate path to a high school diploma, the value-add goes far beyond pounds and pence.

Likewise, regardless of Parthenon's culture, the firm is worthless if it does not deliver value through actionable advice to clients. One illustrative example of client impact in a high-stakes environment is my work as a legislative aide to a Maryland State Legislature delegate representing 100k constituents. 90 days to run the affairs of a state numbering 6 million. 4 person legislative office where I'm the only legislative full-timer.

I reworked the logistics backend to deliver mailed session status reports to 6k people. I shepherded 3 bills from conception to passage, all of which play their small part in keeping Maryland healthy. I coordinated closely with stakeholders to the Insurance and Health Disparities subcommittees. I was exposed to the complexities of the legislative process, revolving around the competing interest of doctors, hospitals, insurers, pharma and device manufacturers. None of this would have been possible without teamwork, effective communication and wholehearted dedication to the client, in this case the delegate and his constituents. More important than any individual outcome, I learned how to manage up, to best provide the delegate with actionable material, as well as laterally, to coordinate with legislative staff in other offices.


%Fairly or unfairly, DPhil applicants can be stereotyped as lacking in client management skills and knowledge of broader business ecosystems. To allay these concerns, I've worked to develop these skills outside of the research environment. 


%On the ecosystem side, I built foundational knowledge through coursework in econometrics, business strategy and corporate finance. This includes a business-focused study abroad in Denmark to better understand the Nordic model, an undergraduate capstone project ascertaining the appropriateness of different GDP measures and a science commercialization course at the Sa\"\i d Business School. To gain exposure to biotech in particular, I took the initiative and volunteered at exclusive industry conferences.

%As I've worked mostly with small research teams and start-ups, I've used this summer as an opportunity to learn more about the types of problems facing larger tech-focused firms, eventually landing in a R\&D role with NaturalMotion, a mid-sized games, animation and AI technology firm. The goal for this summer is to compare/contrast the small-scale environs I'm accustomed to, with the additional complications of running a larger firm. For example, the company is scaling very quickly and is increasingly struggling to maintain its culture; a problem class that I suspect faces many McKinsey clients after rapid organic growth or a large acquisition.

For Parthenon, my value added is the ability to reduce ideas to practice, through both data analysis and coordination with key stakeholders. In the mid-term, I'm excited by the prospect of working with a diverse array of clients. In the long-term, I look forward to specializing where my technical background can be brought to bare on client's toughest challenges, for example with the Life Sciences practice.
